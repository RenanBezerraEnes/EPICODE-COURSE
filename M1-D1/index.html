		<p>
			I am Renan Bezerra and I'm from Brazil but nowdays I am living in Germany.
			I had lived two years and a half in Ireland before I came to Germany. My
			first contact with IT or better saying with technology were when I was
			around 13 years old and I did a course about hardware. Since that time I
			had never studied again. I started to study IT because my brother and
			friends are working with it and I wanted to change my life and I could
			realise that I could stay hours and hours study IT and I didn't get bored
			at all. So I am excited about Strive school and I will try my best.

				On my freetime I like to watch Football, meet my friends, stay with my
				family and of course when I am in holiday I like to visit other
				countries and get know new cultures and food and I also like to cook.
